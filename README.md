# Surf Timer

Simple surf timer plugin for sourcmod, compatible with Counter-Strike: Source.

This was created out of frustration from setting up the [Shavit Surf Timer](https://github.com/bhopppp/Shavit-Surf-Timer) plugin, I just wanted Speed/Timer functionality without the fluff. I was having issues with many map's zones not working so i've refactored all the zones from (https://github.com/wrldspawn/surf-zones) to a new format with only Start/End zones.

# Requirements

- [Metamod](https://sourcemm.net/downloads.php) v1.12 or higher.
- [Sourcemod](https://sourcemod.net/downloads.php) v1.12 or higher.
- Extension [sm-ripext](https://github.com/ErikMinekus/sm-ripext) for zone api.

# Zones

Zone information is loaded via http from (https://github.com/christ-pher/surf-zones)

# TODO

- [x] Speed/Velocity
- [x] Linear Timer
- [x] API Loaded Start/End Zoning
- [ ] Persistent Time/Record Keeping
